Rust Program to Compute Function Values

This Rust program computes the values of a function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 6 for a range of input values x. The input values are specified as a range of values with a start value, end value, and step size. The program then computes the corresponding output values y by plugging in the input values x into the function f(x).

Usage

To use this Rust program, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can download and install it from the official Rust website at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

Once you have Rust installed, follow these steps to run the program:

Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it to a local folder.
Navigate to the program folder: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the program.
Compile the program: Run the following command to compile the program:
css
Copy code
$ rustc main.rs
This will compile the Rust code and generate an executable file named main in the same folder.
Run the program: Once the program is compiled, you can run it by using the following command:
shell
Copy code
$ ./main
This will execute the program and generate an output file named output.csv in the same folder.
View the output: You can view the contents of the output.csv file using a text editor or a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The file contains two columns with the input values x in the first column and the corresponding output values y in the second column.
Program Parameters

The Rust program accepts the following parameters:

start: The start value of the input range (inclusive). Default: 0.0.
end: The end value of the input range (inclusive). Default: 10.0.
step: The step size of the input range. Default: 1.0.
These parameters can be modified in the Rust code to change the range of input values and the step size.
